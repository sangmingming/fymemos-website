                Introduction
            </h2><p >
                This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand our
                practices regarding any information we might collect from you or
                that you provide to us, the ways in which we use this
                information, and how we handle it.<br  /> Given
                that we do not collect any personal data or non-personal data, our
                practices are straightforward and committed to safeguarding your
                privacy.
            </p><br  /><h2 >
                Personal Data Collection and Use
            </h2><p >
                FyMemos is an open-source application, and we are dedicated to
                user privacy. In line with this, we confirm that we do not
                collect, store, process, or use any personal data or
                non-personal data from you while you use our application. <br
                    
                /> Personal data refers to any information that could potentially
                identify you as an individual. Non-personal data refers to any information
                that does not directly identify you and is aggregated or anonymized.
                Since we do not collect any such information, there's no possibility
                of us using, sharing, or selling this data.
            </p><br  /><h2 >Security</h2><p
                
            >
                As FyMemos does not collect any data, there are no concerns
                regarding the transmission or storage of data. However, we still
                prioritize the security of our application and the trust you
                place in us by using it.
            </p><br  /><h2 >
                Third-Party Data Collection
            </h2><p >
                While FyMemos itself does not collect any personal or
                non-personal data, it is important to note that users may still
                be subject to data collection by third parties such as operating
                systems (e.g. Android, iOS), device manufacturers, and other
                apps that have permissions to access device data. We have no
                control over and assume no responsibility for the data practices
                of these third parties. We encourage users to review the privacy
                policies of their operating system and device manufacturer to
                better understand their data practices.
            </p><br  /><h2 >
                Changes to this Privacy Policy
            </h2><p >
                We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you
                are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We
                will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy
                on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they
                are posted on this page.
